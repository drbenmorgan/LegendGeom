# LegendGeom
Legend simulation geometry management system

Demonstrate a proof of principle system, managing a baseline Legend simulation geometry in Python.

Depends on [PyG4ometry:](http://www.pp.rhul.ac.uk/bdsim/pyg4ometry/index.html)

Run testscript.py for output to terminal. See the list of logical volumes and physical volumes created and how to get hold of positioning information on dedicated detector 
locations in the geometry as example.
